In your Docker Compose file, you have the Moodle data directory mapped to a volume on the host:

```yaml
volumes:
\- \./moodledata\_data:/var/www/html/moodledata
```

Here are some things you can check:

Ensure that the ./moodledata\_data directory exists on your Docker host and has the correct permissions. You can adjust the permissions using the chmod command, for example:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 ./moodledata\_data
```
This command gives all users read, write, and execute permissions for the directory. In a production environment, you should restrict these permissions as much as possible for security reasons.

The user running the web server inside the Docker container (usually www-data for Apache) needs to have write permissions for the `/var/www/html/moodledata` directory.

You can change the owner of the directory to www-data using the chown command:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data ./moodledata\_data
```
However, this command needs to be run inside the Docker container, not on the host. You can do this by opening a shell in the Docker container using the `docker exec` command:

```bash
docker exec -it `<container-id>` /bin/bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/moodledata
```

Replace `<container-id>` with the ID of your Moodle container.

If you are still having problems, it might be worth checking that the Moodle configuration file is correctly set up to use this data directory.

Please remember that these suggestions are meant for debugging and may not be suitable for a production environment, especially the suggestion to use chmod 777. It's important to properly secure your Moodle data directory in a production environment.

clear all data from docker *this will erase all volume data too*

```bash
# check all container aare stopped
docker-compose ps

# if they're any running
docker-compose down

# remove images 
docker image prune

# remove volume
docker volume prune

# clean system
docker system prune
```

installation setup error: file permission

```bash

# change owner
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu moodledata_data

# set read write execute 
sudo chmod 777 moodledata_data

# enter the container
docker exec -ts lms_moodle_1 bash

# ensure the owner `www-data` has right me

ls -la /var/www/html

# if not as below
    # drwxrwxrwt  1 www-data www-data 4096 May 13 12:16 .
    # drwxr-xr-x  1 root     root     4096 Apr 22 18:33 ..
    # drwxrwxr-x 60 www-data www-data 4096 May 13 11:11 moodle
    # drwxrwxrwx  5 www-data www-data 4096 May 13 12:48 moodledata

RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/moodle

RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/moodledata
